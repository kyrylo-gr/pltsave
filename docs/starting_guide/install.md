# Installation pltsave

You can install the `pltsave` library using either pip or by pulling the repository directly from GitHub.

## Option 1: Install via Pip

Open your terminal and run the following command

```sh
pip install pltsave
```

## Option 2: Install from GitHub

You can also install `pltsave` directly from its GitHub repository. This option is useful if you want to work with the latest development version or if you need to customize the library. Here's how to do it:

1. Clone the `pltsave` repository from GitHub using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kyrylo-gr/pltsave.git
```

2. Enter the directory and install the package.

```sh
cd pltsave
pip install .
```

Instead `pip install .` you can run `python setup.py develop` if you prefer.

## That's it!

You've successfully installed the `pltsave` library. And it's super easy to use. See [how to use page](how_to_use.md) for more details.
